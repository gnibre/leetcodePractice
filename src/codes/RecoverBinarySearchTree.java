     * have no idea whtat's that O(N) space algorithm is... after read it.
     * 
     * 
     * tree traversal, in order traverse and find the bad two?   we can find it. but seems hard to swap...
     * 
     * for a tree problem, solve it from top down is most of time a good choice; 
     * 
     * cause most of time, we can devide the problem into two part:   left-subtree and right-subtree; and we can use recursive.
     * 
     * 
     * 1 , is top swapped by mistake? 
     *   A , top swap with some node in left tree;  =>    top? top.left;    top<top.right
     * 
     * =============================== xxxxxxxxxxx ooops, can't find a solution by top down 
     * 
     * do find a solution by traversal;
     * 
     * 1 , got the traversal node list.  
     * 2,  as the mistake is by swap; we can at most found 2 conflicts  in  the in order traversal arraylist.
     * 3, record the conflict, ; if only one conflict; swap these two
     *                             if two conflictes found,  left-one of first conflict and right one of second conflict are swaped one
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * ============================================================
     * after reading the discus, 
     * what i did, is actually good, except the inorder traversal; 
     * cause the recursive function call himself uses function stack and cost O(log n) space while traversing;
     * 
     * how to traversal a tree using O(1) space?        It's called threaded Binary Tree;!
     *  /// the traversal is called  Morris Traversal 
     *  http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inorder-tree-traversal-without-recursion-and-without-stack/
     *  
     *  how? 1 create links to in-order successor, when visiting, use these links.
     *  1. Initialize current as root 
		2. While current is not NULL
   			If current does not have left child
      			a) Print currentâ€™s data
      			b) Go to the right, i.e., current = current->right
   			Else
      			a) Make current as right child of the rightmost node in current's left subtree
      			b) Go to this left child, i.e., current = current->left
